# Issue Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Login Page - Missing Icons
**Problem:** Email and password icons were not showing in the login form

**Root Cause:** Bootstrap Icons CSS was not loaded

**Solution:** Added Bootstrap Icons CDN link to `public/index.html`
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.1/font/bootstrap-icons.css">
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Icons will now display correctly

## Issues Identified (Data-Related)

### ⚠️ 2. Employee Records - "N/A" Values
**Problem:** Employee ID and other fields showing "N/A" in the table and view modal

**Root Cause:** This is a **DATA ISSUE**, not a code issue. The employee records in the database don't have values for:
- `employee_id`
- `nickname`
- `gender`
- `birth_date`
- `age`
- `place_of_birth`
- Other optional fields

**Why "N/A" is Correct:**
The code is working as designed:
```javascript
{emp.employee_profile?.employee_id || 'N/A'}
```
This means: "Show employee_id if it exists, otherwise show 'N/A'"

**Solution Options:**

#### Option A: Populate Missing Data (Recommended)
1. Go to Employee Records
2. Click "Edit" on each employee
3. Fill in the missing fields (Employee ID, Gender, Birth Date, etc.)
4. Save the changes

#### Option B: Auto-generate Employee IDs (Backend Fix)
Add a migration or seeder to auto-generate employee IDs for existing employees:

```php
// In Laravel backend
$employees = EmployeeProfile::whereNull('employee_id')->get();
foreach ($employees as $employee) {
    $employee->employee_id = 'EMP' . str_pad($employee->id, 4, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT);
    $employee->save();
}
```

#### Option C: Hide "N/A" for Optional Fields
Modify the display logic to show empty string instead of "N/A" for optional fields:

```javascript
// Instead of:
{emp.employee_profile?.nickname || 'N/A'}

// Use:
{emp.employee_profile?.nickname || '—'}
// or
{emp.employee_profile?.nickname || ''}
```

### ⚠️ 3. View Employee Modal - Altered Input Fields
**Problem:** The view modal shows "edits remaining" text for certain fields

**Root Cause:** This is an **INTENTIONAL FEATURE**, not a bug. The system has edit restrictions:

**Field Categories:**
1. **Non-editable after first save:**
   - first_name, last_name, nickname, place_of_birth, gender, birth_date
   - position, department, employment_status, hire_date, salary, tenurity
   - sss, philhealth, pagibig, tin_no

2. **Limited edits (3 times max):**
   - civil_status, email, contact_number
   - emergency_contact_name, emergency_contact_phone
   - province, barangay, city, postal_code, present_address

3. **Freely editable:**
   - All other fields

**Why This Exists:**
This is a data integrity feature to prevent unauthorized changes to critical employee information.

**If You Want to Remove This:**
Edit `src/pages/HrAssistant/EmployeeRecords.js` and modify the `canEditField` function to always return `true`.
